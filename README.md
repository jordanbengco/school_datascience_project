# sensor data project

Project for cmpt 353.

Report:

- The problem you are addressing, particularly how you refined the provided data

- The data that you use: how it was gathered, cleared, etc.

- Techniques you used to analyse the data.
Use Kalman filtering to smooth out the data.


- Your results/findings/conclusions

- Some appropriate visualizations of your data/results

- Limitations: problems you encountered, things you would do if you had more time, things you should have done it retrospective.
Finding velocity from acceleration using intergrals caused the results to blow up. (walking 30s caused my velocity to reach 120m/s)
