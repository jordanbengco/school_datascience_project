Question to answer with analysis:
1. How does walking pace(steps/minute or similar) differ between people? Does it vary by age, gender, height?

2. Can you calculate walking speed (m/s) from just the accelerometer? How accurate can you get? Can you then determine difference between subjects as above?

3. Are the results better depending on where the phone is? Ankle vs pocket vs hand? Ankle above or below?

How to answer:
2) 
Calculate Speed: Write a functions to calculate distance traveled using x,y,z (probably just x and y). 

Test Accuracy: ??

Differentiate Between Subjects: Compare the "error" after smoothing. Compare the z value in some way. 

3) 
Compare results: Estimate correct results (some data cleaning technique). Compare the 'error' in each result by using inferential stats. Compare the change in the smoothed data.
